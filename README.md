# NflDepthCharts

Dev Environment:

Windows
Visual Studio 2022

Assumption Made:
1. No logging is required 
2. when adding new player if the list is empty, the position depth is always 0 even position depth is specified
3. should not be able to add duplicated player. Updating player will require removing the player first
4. different team will have different business logic of adding player to depth chart
5. player's name cannnot be empty
6. Exception handling is not important for this exercise

To Run the App:
1. open the project by using Visual Studio 2022 or a version that support .NET 8.0
1. Set NflDepthcharts as the Startup project
2. Start Debugging
