# NflDepthCharts

Dev Environment:

Windows
Visual Studio 2022

Assumption Made:
1. No logging is required 
2. when adding new player if the list is empty, the position depth is always 0 even position depth is specified
3. should not be able to add duplicated player. Updating player will require removing the player first

To Run the App:
1. Set NflDepthcharts as the Startup project
2. Start Debugging
